SYNOPSIS
	cross [command|package] package

DESCRIPTION
	Cross is a tool to build a cross toolchain on SliTaz GNU/Linux. The
	ARM platform is actually supported and x86_64 toolchain is on the
	stove

COMMANDS
	Run: cross usage

OPTIONS
	--log      clean: Will also clean log files
	--install  check-env: Install needed packages
	--config=  Use specified configuration file

HOWTO:
	When building a cross toolchain it's better to understand what is a
	linker or or C compiler such as GCC. The configure option --target is
	used by 'cross' to build cross-tools. When the toolchain is build on
	your machine you can then build packages with cook and the wok. Cross
	use by default the same source tarball's than cook but path can by
	changed via the config file. Configuration is: cross.conf. Here is a
	cmdline howto:

	Create a chroot (use last tazdev)
	---------------------------------
	# tazdev gen-chroot --arch=arm
	# tazdev chroot

	Clone cookutils to get last cook and cross
	------------------------------------------
	# tazpkg -gi mercurial
	# tazpkg -gi make
	# cd && hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/cookutils
	# cd cookutils
	# make install-cross

	Setup the build environment and compile a cross toolchain
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	# cook setup
	# cook arm-setup
	(vi/nano /etc/slitaz/cross.conf)
	# cross check-env --install
	# cross compile

	Test the cross toolchain
	------------------------
	# cross testsuite
