SYNOPSIS
	cross [command|package] package

DESCRIPTION
	Cross is a tool to build a cross toolchain on SliTaz GNU/Linux. The
	ARM platform is actually supported and x86_64 toolchain is on the
	stove

COMMANDS
	Run: cross usage

OPTIONS
	--log      clean: Will also clean log files
	--install  check-env: Install needed packages

HOWTO:
	When building a cross toolchain it's better to understand what is a
	linker or or C compiler such as GCC. The configure option --target is
	used by 'cross' to build cross-tools. When the toolchain is build on
	your machine you can then build packages with cook and the wok. Here
	is commands used to create a chroot (use last tazdev):

	# tazdev gen-chroot --arch=arm
	# tazdev chroot

	--> Clone cookutils to get last cook and cross
	# tazpkg -gi mercurial
	# tazpkg -gi make
	# cd && hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/cookutils
	# cd cookutils
	# make install-cross

	--> Now setup the build environment and compile a cross toolchain:
	# cook setup
	# cook arm-setup
	# mkdir -p /home/slitaz/cross
	# cd /home/slitaz/cross
	# cp /etc/slitaz/cross.conf .
	(vi/nano config)
	# cross check-env --install
	# cross compile

	--> Test the cross tools
	# cross testsuite
