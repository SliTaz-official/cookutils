<h2>SliTaz Cook &amp; Cooker</h2>

<p>
	The SliTaz Cookutils provide tools and utils to help build SliTaz packages. They
	are easy to use and learn, fast and light. You will be able to create SliTaz
	packages in a few commands. The cookutils provide the 'cook' utility and the
	<a href="#cooker">Cooker</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Cook lets you compile and create a package, provide a log file and check the
	receipt/package quality. The Cooker is a build bot with more automation
	and can be used as a frontend to cook since it provides a CGI/web interface
	which lets you view cook logs in a nice and colored way. Cook and the Cooker
	use the same DB files and wok, they both share <a href="#blocked">blocked</a>
	and broken packages as well as any activity.
</p>
<p>
	For technical information, for example the coding style, etc, please refer to the
	README found in the source tree or in /usr/share/doc/cookutils.
</p>

<h3>Cook usage</h3>
<p>
	Cook provides a small built-in help usage that you can display with the
	command 'usage'. It also has some options to perform special tasks on
	a package before cooking it or afterwards. To get help and usage:
</p>
<pre>
# cook usage
</pre>

<h3>Howto</h3>
<p>
	The first thing you will have to do before building packages is setup
	your environment. The 2 recommended ways of working: cook directly on host
	or cook in chroot to protect your host. In the case you want to work in a
	chroot you can install and use Tazdev to create one and chroot into it: 
</p>
<pre>
# tazdev gen-chroot &amp;&amp; tazdev chroot
</pre>
<p>
	By default Tazdev creates a chroot in /home/slitaz/cooking/chroot but you
	can specify a custom path in the argument. The chroot location is not
	important, when you will be in the chroot you will use standard SliTaz
	paths such as /home/slitaz/wok for the wok directory or /home/slitaz/log
	for all the cook logs. As usual you can display tazdev help usage with:
	tazdev usage.
</p>
<p>
	When you use a chroot there are 2 special directories mounted with the bind
	option: src and packages. The sources for all packages are stored by default
	in /home/slitaz/src, this directory is mounted into the chroot so the utils
	can use them. This method lets you share sources between many chroots such
	as one for cooking and one for stable. The packages directory default
	location is: /home/slitaz/[version]/packages so they are not in the chroot
	and are safe in case the chroot is removed by error.
</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
	So you have decided the way you want to work, so lets prepare the cook environment.
	Cook uses the cook.conf configuration file, if you want to use custom paths for
	SliTaz directories and files, you'll have to modify it. The setup will create
	some directories and files to keep trace of activity and errors, all files
	are pure plain text files that you can open in a text editor. To prepare
	your environment:
</p>
<pre>
# cook setup
</pre>
<p>
	The setup command has a --wok option which lets you clone a SliTaz wok while
	setting up your cook environment. Even if you are not yet an official developer
	you can	clone it and use existing packages as an example to create your own.
	To setup and clone the default cooking wok or the undigest wok:
</p>
<pre>
# cook setup --wok
# cook setup --undigest
</pre>

<h3>Test your environment</h3>
<p>
	Cook provides a test command which will create a package and cook it. This lets
	you see if your environment is working and it provides an example package with
	a receipt. The dummy package is named 'cooktest' and can be removed after
	testing. To cook the test package:
</p>
<pre>
# cook test
</pre>

<h3>Create and cook</h3>
<p>
	If your environment is setup correctly you can start creating and compiling
	SliTaz packages from your wok. To create a new package with an empty receipt
	(you can also create a receipt interactively):
</p>
<pre>
# cook new pkgname
# cook new pkgname --interactive
</pre>
<p>
	If you have just created a new package, you'll have to edit the receipt with your
	favorite text editor. When the receipt is ready or if you have an existing
	package, you can cook it:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname
</pre>
<p>
	If all went well you will find your package in the $SLITAZ/packages
	directory and any produced files in $SLITAZ/wok/pkgname.
</p>

<h3>Cook and install</h3>
<p>
	If you want to cook and install the package in one command:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname --install
</pre>

<h3>Get sources</h3>
<p>
	If you want or need to download only the source of a package without
	building it, you can use the option --getsrc as below:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname --getsrc
</pre>

<h3>Clean packages</h3>
<p>
	After compilation and packaging there are several files in the wok that take up
	disk space. To clean a single package:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname --clean
</pre>
<p>
	You can also clean the full wok at once or you can choose to keep SliTaz
	related files and just remove the source:
</p>
<pre>
# cook clean-wok
# cook clean-src
</pre>

<h3>Search</h3>
<p>
	Cook provides a simple search function to quickly find a package in the
	wok. It uses grep and so supports regular expressions:
</p>
<pre>
# cook search busybox
</pre>

<h3>Receipt functions</h3>
<p>
	Many packages provide the same kind of files such as *-dev packages
	with static libs, pkgconfig files and include headers. So cook provides
	a function to be used in the receipt:
</p>
<pre>
get_dev_files     : Install /usr/lib/{lib.*a,pkgconfig} /usr/include
</pre>

<h3>Packages DB list</h3>
<p>
	Cook can list packages in the wok and also create a suitable packages list
	for Tazpkg. This lets you create a local packages repository quite easily
	and is used to create the official SliTaz packages list found on the mirrors. 
	To list the current wok used by cook (you don't need to be root):
</p>
<pre>
$ cook list-wok
</pre>
<p>
	When creating the packages DB, cook will check if you have a flavors repo in
	/home/slitaz/flavors, if so, it will pack all flavors using the latest
	packages list available. To create a packages list and the Live flavors
	files:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgdb
</pre>

<h3 id="cooker">The Cooker</h3>
<p>
	The Cooker is a Build Bot, its first function is to check for commits in a wok,
	create an ordered cooklist and cook all modified packages. It can also be
	used as a frontend to cook since they both use the same files. The Cooker can
	also be used to cook a big list of packages at once such as all the packages
	in a flavor. The Cooker provides a nice CGI/Web interface that works by
	default on any SliTaz system since it provides CGI support via the Busybox httpd
	web server.
</p>
<p>
	The Cooker provides a small built-in help usage and short command switch.
	For example to display usage you can use:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker usage
# cooker -u
</pre>

<h3>Cooker setup</h3>
<p>
	Like cook, the Cooker needs a working environment before starting to use it.
	The main difference with the cook environment is that the Cooker needs 2 woks.
	One Hg and clean wok as a reference and one build wok. In this way it is easy
	to compare both woks and get modifications. If you already have a cook
	environment, you must move your wok before setting up the Cooker or it
	will complain. Setup will also install a set of development packages that
	can be configured in the cook.conf configuration file and the variable
	SETUP_PKGS. To setup your cooker environment:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker setup
</pre>
<p>
	If all went well you now have 2 woks, base development packages installed
	and all needed files created. The default behavior is to check for commits,
	you can run a test:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker
</pre>

<h3>Cooker cook</h3>
<p>
	Again, 2 ways to work now: make changes in the clean Hg wok and launch the
	cooker without any arguments or cook packages manually. The cooker lets you
	cook a single package or all packages of a category or a flavor. You can also
	try to build all unbuilt packages, but be aware the Cooker was not designed
	to handle thousands of packages.
</p>
<p>
	To cook a single package which is the same as 'cook pkgname' but with more
	logs:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker pkg pkgname
</pre>
<p>
	To cook more than one package at once you have different kind of choices.
	You can use an existing package such as used for Live flavors, you can also
	use a custom list using the package names listed line by line. Finally you can 
	build all packages of a category.
</p>
<pre>
# cooker flavor [name]
# cooker list [/path/to/cooklist]
# cooker cat [category]
</pre>
<p>
	The Cooker lets you also recook a specific Hg revision. It's useful in
	production so that if the Build Bot was interrupted while cooking commits, you
	can then cook packages manually:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker rev 9496
</pre>

<h3 id="blocked">Blocked packages</h3>
<p>
	Cook and the Cooker handle a file with a list of blocked package so they will
	not cook when commits happen or if a cooklist is used. This is very useful
	for a Cooker Build Bot in production. When you block or unblock a package
	you can add a note to the cooknotes. Blocking packages example:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname --block
# cooker block pkgname
# cooker -n "Blocked pkgname note"
</pre>
<p>
	The list of blocked packages are also displayed on the Cooker web interface.
	To unblock a package you have to use the unblock command or cook --unblock
	option:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname --unblock
# cooker unblock pkgname
</pre>

<h3>Cooker CGI/Web</h3>
<p>
	To let you view log files in a nice way, keep trace of activity and help find
	errors, you can use the Cooker Web interface located by default in the folder
	/var/www/cooker. If you don't use a chroot and the Busybox httpd web server
	is running, the web interface will work without configuration and should be
	reachable at: <a href="http://localhost/cooker/cooker.cgi">
		http://localhost/cooker/cooker.cgi</a> 
</p>
<p>
	If you used a chroot environment, you should also install cookutils on your
	host and modify the SLITAZ path variable. A standard working way is to have
	a chroot in:
</p>
<pre>
/home/slitaz/cooking/chroot
</pre>
<p>
	With /etc/slitaz/cook.conf modified as below:
</p>
<pre>
SLITAZ="/home/slitaz/cooking/chroot/home/slitaz"
</pre>
<p>
	Note: It's not obligatory to install the cookutils on your host to use the
	web interface. If you use Lighttpd you can also copy the cooker.cgi and
	style.css files for example into your ~/Public directory and use a custom
	cook.conf with it. The advantage of installing cookutils on the host is to
	get regular updates via the Tazpkg packages manager. Say you have cloned or
	downloaded the cookutils:
</p>
<pre>
$ cp -a cookutils/web ~/Public/cgi-bin/cooker
$ cp -f cookutils/cook.conf ~/Public/cgi-bin/cooker
</pre>
<p>
	Edit the configuration file: ~/Public/cgi-bin/cooker/cook.conf to set your
	SLITAZ path and you're all done!
</p>

<h3>Cooknotes</h3>
<p>
	The cooknotes feature lets you write small personal notes about packaging
	and is useful for collaboration. The cooknotes was coded to let the SliTaz
	Cooker bot maintainers share notes between themselves and other contributors.
	The Cooker can block a package's build or recook packages manually, for example
	it's nice to make a note if a package is blocked so that the maintainer knows why
	admin did that. Cooknotes are displayed on the web interface and can be
	checked from a cmdline:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker note "Blocked pkgname due to heavy CPU load"
# cooker notes
</pre>

<h3>Cooker as a Build Bot</h3>
<p>
	The Cooker is designed to be a Built Bot for SliTaz, this means it monitors
	2 woks, updates the Hg wok, gets the differences and cooks all packages that
	have been committed. The safer and cleaner way to run the Cooker as a Build
	Bot with cron is to use a chroot environment, but it can run directly on the
	host if you want.
</p>
<p>
	To run The Cooker automatically you must use cron from the chroot and add a
	single line to root crontabs in /var/spool/cron/crontabs. Say you would like
	to run the Cooker every 2 hours:
</p>
<pre>
* */2 * * * /usr/bin/cooker
</pre>

<h3>Cooker BB started at boot</h3>
<p>
	The Cooker environment and cron task can automatically be started at boot time.
	You must have the cookutils-daemon installed on the host and use a standard SliTaz
	installation to make it work properly (cooking goes in /home/slitaz/cooking). The 
	daemon script will mount any virtual filesystems if needed as well as source and
	packages. Source files are in /home/slitaz/src and bound into the chroot
	so you can share package's sources between several versions (stable, cooking,
	undigest). If the package is not yet installed:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg get-install cookutils-daemon
</pre>
<p>
	To start the daemon you must have a cron file definition for
	root in the chroot, the daemon script works like all other system daemons
	and can be handled with:
</p>
<pre>
# /etc/init.d/cooker [start|stop|restart]
</pre>
