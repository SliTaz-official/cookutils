<h2>SliTaz Cook &amp; Cooker</h2>

<p>
	The SliTaz Cookutils provide tools and utils to build SliTaz packages. They
	are easy to use and learn, fast and light. You will be able to create SliTaz
	in a few commands. The cookutils provide the 'cook' utility and the
	<a href="#cooker">Cooker</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Cook let you compile and create a package, provide a log file and check
	receipt/package quality. The Cooker is a build bot with more automation
	and can be used as a frontend to cook, since it provide a CGI/web interface
	who let you view cook logs in a nice and colored way.
</p>

<h3>Howto work</h3>
<p>
	The first thing you will have to do before building packages is to setup
	your environment. These 2 recommended way to work: cook directly on host
	or cook in chroot to protect your host. In the case you want to work in a
	chroot you can use Tazdev to create one and chroot in it: 
</p>
<pre>
# tazdev gen-chroot &amp;&amp; tazdev chroot
</pre>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
	So you decided the way you want to work, so let prepare the cook environement.
	Cook use cook.conf configuration file, if you want to use custom path for
	SliTaz directories and files, you have to modify it. The setup will create
	some directories and files to keep trace on activity and error, all files
	are pure plain text files that you can open in a text editor. To prepare
	you environment:
</p>
<pre>
# cook setup
</pre>

<h3>Test your environment</h3>
<p>
	Cook provide a test command who will create a package and cook it. This let
	you see if your enviroment and by the it provide and example package with
	a receipt. The create package is named 'cooktest' and can be removed after
	testing. To cook the cooktest:
</p>
<pre>
# cook test
</pre>

<h3>Create and cook</h3>
<p>
	If you environment is setup corectly you can start creating and compiling
	SliTaz packages from your wok. To create a new package with an empty receipt:
</p>
<pre>
# cook new pkgname
</pre>
<p>
	If you just created a new package, you have to edit the receipt with your
	favorite text editor. When the receipt is ready or if you have existing
	packages, you can cook it:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname
</pre>
<p>
	If all went well you will find your packages in $SLITAZ/packages
	directory and produced files in $SLITAZ/wok/pkgname. If you want to cook
	and install the package in one command:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname --install
</pre>

<h3>Clean packages</h3>
<p>
	After compilation and packaging ther is several files in the wok that take
	disk space. To clean a single package:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkgname --clean
</pre>
<p>
	You can also clean the full wok at once or you can choose to keep SliTaz
	related files and just remove the source:
</p>
<pre>
# cook clean-wok
# cook clean-src
</pre>

<h3>Packages lists</h3>
<p>
	Cook can list packages in the wok but also create suitable packages list
	for Tazpkg. That let you create a locale packages repository quiet easily
	and is used to create official SliTaz packages list found on mirrors. To
	list the current wok used by cook (you dont need to be root):
</p>
<pre>
$ cook list-wok
</pre>
<p>
	To create packages lists:
</p>
<pre>
# cook pkglist
</pre>

<a name="cooker"></a>
<h3>The Cooker</h3>
<p>
	The Cooker is a Build Bot, it first usage is to check for commits in a wok,
	create an ordered cooklist and cook all modified packages. It can also be
	used as a frontend to cook since they use the same files. The Cooker can
	also be used to cook a big list of packages at once such has all package
	of a flavor. The Cooker provide a nice CGI/Web interface that works by
	default on any SliTaz system since we provide CGI support via Busybox httpd
	web server.
</p>

<h3>Cooker setup</h3>
<p>
	Like cook, the Cooker needs a working environment before starting using it.
	The main difference with the cook environment is that the Cooker needs 2 wok.
	One Hg and clean wok as reference and one build wok, in this way is is easy
	to compare both wok and get modifications. If you already have a cook
	environement, you must move your wok before setting up the Cooker or it
	will complain:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker --setup
</pre>
<p>
	If all went well you have now 2 wok, base developement packages installed
	and all needed files created. The default behavor is to check for commits,
	you can run a test:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker
</pre>

<h3>Cooker cook</h3>
<p>
	Again, 2 way to work now: make change in the clean Hg wok and launch the
	cooker without any argument or cook packages manually. The cooker let you
	cook a single package, all packages of a category or a flavor. You can also
	try to build all unbuilt packages, but be aware the Cooker was not designed
	to handle thousand of packages.
</p>
<p>
	To cook a single package wich is the same than 'cook pkgname' but with more
	logs:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker --pkg=pkgname
</pre>
<p>
	To cook more than one package at once you have different kind of choices.
	The currently implemeted ways (more will come such as --list=):
</p>
<pre>
# cooker --cat=category
# cooker --flavor=flavo
</pre>

<h3>Cooker CGI/Web</h3>
<p>
	To let you view log files in a nice way, keep activity trace and help find
	errors, you can use the Cooker Web interface located by default in
	/var/www/cooker. If you dont use a chroot and the Busybox httpd web server
	is running, the web interface will work without modifiaction and should be
	reachable at: <a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/cooker/cooker.cgi">
		http://localhost/cgi-bin/cooker/cooker.cgi</a> 
</p>
<p>
	If you used a chroot environment, you should also install cookutils on your
	host and modify the SLITAZ path variable. A standard working way is to have
	a chroot in:
</p>
<pre>
/home/slitaz/cooking/chroot
</pre>
<p>
With /etc/slitaz/cook.conf modified as bellow:
</p>
<pre>
SLITAZ="/home/slitaz/cooking/chroot/home/slitaz"
</pre>
<p>
	Note: It's not obligatory to install the cookutils on your host to use the
	web interface, you can also copy the cooker.cgi and style.css files for
	example in your ~/Public directory and use a custom cook.conf with it. Say
	you have cloned or downloaded the cookutils:
</p>
<pre>
$ cp cookutils/web ~/Public/cgi-bin/cooker
$ cp cookutils/cook.conf ~/Public/cgi-bin/cooker
</pre>
<p>
Edit ~/Public/cgi-bin/cooker/cook.conf and you all done!
</p>

<h3>Cooknotes</h3>
<p>
	The cooknotes feature let you write small personnal notes about packaging
	and is usefull for collaboration. The cooknotes was coded to let SliTaz
	Cooker bot maintainer share notes between them self and other contributors.
	The Cooker can block packages build or recook packages manually, for example
	it's nice to make a note if a package is blocked so the maintainer know why
	admin did that. Cooknotes are displayed on the web interface and can be
	checked from cmdline:
</p>
<pre>
# cooker --note="Blocked pkgname due to heavy CPU load"
# cooker --notes
</pre>
