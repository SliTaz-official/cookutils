You can use a variable COOKOPTS in the receipts to adjust certain aspects of the
preparation of a package. Multiple options are allowed, that can be written
together or separated by spaces, tabs or any other symbols.

Example of use:

    COOKOPTS="!menus !pngz"


Currently, the following options are recognized:

!pixmaps
    Don't copy icons from a /usr/share/pixmaps folder as well as from stuff
    folder (the same action that made obsolete option `GENERIC_PIXMAPS="no"`).

!menus
    Don't copy desktop files from a /usr/share/applications folder (the same
    action that made obsolete option `GENERIC_MENUS="no"`).

!fixdesktops
    Don't fix common errors and warnings in the .desktop files.

!strip
    Don't strip executable files, shared and static libraries, as well as remove
    Python (*.pyc and *.pyo) and Perl (perllocal.pod and .packlist) files.

!manz
    Don't compress all man pages.

!pngz
    Don't compress all png images. Image compression allows you to save some
    space, but it takes a lot of time.

!pngquant
    Don't use `pngquant` to compress png images. Note, `pngquant` produces
    indexed images (max 256 colors) which can be inappropriate in some cases:
    a few programs (such as SLiM) will not recognize this compressed PNG file
    format.

!optipng
    Don't use `optipng` to compress png images. Note, `optipng` is lossless png
    compressor. Using `pngquant` and `optipng` in conjunction allows to save
    more space.

op0 to op8
    Use specified `optipng` optimization level. The higher the level, the slower
    compression. Note, this option does not have an exclamation mark, because it
    means "don't" and here is "do" otherwise.

!svgz
    Don't compress all svg images.
