You can use a variable COOKOPTS in the receipts to adjust certain aspects of the
preparation of a package. Multiple options are allowed, that can be written
together or separated by spaces, tabs or any other symbols.

Example of use:

    COOKOPTS="!menus !pngz"


Currently, the following options are recognized:

!pixmaps
    Default action is to copy icons from a /usr/share/pixmaps folder as well as
    from the stuff folder (the same action that made obsolete option
    `GENERIC_PIXMAPS="no"`).
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (files will not be
    automatically copied).

!menus
    Default action is to copy desktop files from a /usr/share/applications
    folder (the same action that made obsolete option `GENERIC_MENUS="no"`).
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (files will not be
    automatically copied).

!fixdesktops
    Default action is to fix common errors and warnings in the .desktop files.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (.desktop files
    will not be changed).

!i18nz
    1. Default action is to delete locales that are not currently supported by
    SliTaz while processing desktop files.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (.desktop files
    will contain the original set of locales).
    Please note, this option does not have any action if the `!fixdesktops`
    option is provided (desktop files will not change in any way).
    2. Default action is to keep only supported translations provided by the
    *.mo files.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (all existing *.mo
    files will remain).
    Please note, you can add all the translations to the package, for example,
    using the command: `cook_copy_files *.mo` (then by default only the
    supported locales will be left).

!extradesktops
    Default action is to remove extra information from the desktop files:
    entries such as 'GenericName', 'X-GNOME-FullName' (all X-* are exposed),
    'Terminal=false', Keywords and other sections. This extra information just
    isn't supported in the current (LXDE) environment.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (extra information
    will not be removed from the .desktop files).

!strip
    Default action is to strip executable files, shared and static libraries,
    as well as remove Python (*.pyc and *.pyo) and Perl (perllocal.pod and
    .packlist) files.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (executable files
    and libraries will not be stripped, and Python and Perl files will all be
    left).

!manz
    Default action is to compress all man pages.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (all man pages will
    be left "as is"). Please note that these files may be installed in a
    compressed format.

!gz
    Default action is to recompress all *.gz files (excluding man pages) with
    the better compression ratio.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (all *.gzip files
    will be left "as is").

!pngz
    Default action is to compress all PNG images. Image compression allows you
    to save some space, but it takes a lot of time.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (all PNG images
    will be left "as is").

!pngquant
    Default action is to use `pngquant` while compressing PNG images. Please
    note, `pngquant` produces indexed images (max 256 colors) which can be
    inappropriate in some cases, a few programs (such as SLiM) will not
    recognize this PNG file format.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (`pngquant` will
    not be used).

!optipng
    Default action is to use `optipng` to compress PNG images. Please note,
    `optipng` is a lossless PNG compressor. Using `pngquant` and `optipng` in
    conjunction allows you to save more space.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (`optipng` will not
    be used).

op0 to op8
    Default action is to use optimization level 2 while processing PNG images by
    `optipng`. Using this option you can set the desired `optipng` optimization
    level. The higher the level, the slower the compression and the smaller the
    file size. Please note that this option has no exclamation mark, because it
    means "don't do", and here, on the contrary, "to do".

!svgz
    Default action is to compress all SVG images.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (all SVG images
    will be left "as is").

!uiz
    Default action is to compress Glade UI files. Compression means the removal
    of insignificant spaces and comments.
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (all *.ui and
    *.glade files will be left "as is").

!monorm
    Default action is to normalize *.mo files. Normalization means the
    unconditional conversion to UTF-8, removal of accidental duplicates and
    most of the header lines as well as catalog entries that are not added to
    the translation (when string in msgid equals to string in msgstr).
    The presence of this option overrides the default action (all *.mo files
    will be left "as is").
