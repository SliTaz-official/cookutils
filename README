SliTaz Cookutils
================================================================================


The SliTaz Cookutils provide tools and utils to build SliTaz packages.


cook
----
The cook tool should be used in a chroot environment, simply use the command
'tazdev gen-chroot' to build one. You can also build package directly but
build deps will not be handled correctly since cook will install missing
packages to perform a build and then remove them only if there wasn't
installed before, this way we can keep a clean build environment.

We use standard SliTaz path to work such as /home/slitaz/wok, if you work on
cooking from stable or want to keep a clean system: create a chroot.

Cook features:

    * Setup a build env
    * Check and install missing build deps
    * Compile and generate the package
    * Remove installed build deps
    * Provide a log for each cook
    * Clean a package in the wok

Cook does not:

    * Depends on Hg but can use it to manage a wok
    * Do complex work about compiling the all system from source
    * Check build deps for you, use: BUILD_DEPENDS
      If all deps are also build deps do: BUILD_DEPENDS="$DEPENDS"
    * The work of a Build Bot, unix philosophy: one tool for one task
    * Cook a package if you receipt is crappy :-)

Cook also manage packages list so they can be used for a personnal packages
repository or sent to the official mirror. We create and use:

    * packages.list    Simple list of package-version
    * packages.md5     MD5sum list of all packages
    * packages.desc    Packages with name, version, category, desc
    * packages.equiv   Equivalent paclages list
    * files.list.lzma  A files provides by all packages


cooker
------
The Cooker is a Build Bot who automate the build process but dont do the diner
for you! We need quality receipt to cook succefully and the goal is not to have
a bloated script so please Keep It Short and Simple.

Cmdline tool  : /usr/bin/cooker
Web interface : /var/www/cooker
Cache folder  : /home/slitaz/cache

The web interface consist in one CGI script, 2 xHTML files and a CSS style.
Cook log can are produced by cook and the cooker just act as a fronted to
check them in a nice way.
